        <h3 id="whoheaderhome">Who is Beth?</h3>
        <img id="whophotohome">
        <p id="whoparahome">I am a software engineer with a background in personal training and biomechanics. My core skills include JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.</p>
        <p>I am proud of my ability to allow people to feel heard and empowered. I can strike the perfect balance of pushing someone to the next level without pushing them over the edge.</p>
        <p>I launched a small business at the start of March 2020. I was able to build my business to $100k annual revenue. This experience has taught me to push my comfort zone, take action (and succeed) with skills I was learning on the fly, and to persevere through difficult times.</p>

        <p class="whatphotohome">Beth has the ability to make people feel heard. She is both empowering and patient with her approach to working with people. She is incredibly mindful and meets her clients where they are at. -Kelcie</p>
        <p class="whatphotohome">Beth asked great questions with non-judgmental curiosity. She was professional, efficient and organized. She arrived on time and was always encouraging. She made conversation easily and really cared about me and my family. -Jess</p>
        <p class="whatphotohome">I got placed with Beth by the luck of the draw at my old gym. She teaches the what and why behind exercise, she never asks you to do anything blindly.  At some point you can probably go off on your own, but I can guarantee you won't want to. -Dylan</p>
        <p class="whatphotohome">Although I was a little skeptical of someone so much younger than me, Beths enthusiasm and confidence made me give her a try. I discovered she really does know what she's doing!  -Ellen</p>
        <p class="whatphotohome">My favourite part about my relationship with Beth is our communication. We have always found a way to come to a better understanding and in most cases grow closer and stronger together because of it. -Robey</p>
